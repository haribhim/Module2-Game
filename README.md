**Project Objective**

The objective of this project is to build an embedded system that utilizes potentiometer, joystick, and button inputs for some creative output on Processing or WebSerial. I was inspired by these requirements to create a game, because it seemed like the best way to use all of the components within their intrinsic functionality. I modeled my game off of this [example project](https://www.toptal.com/game/ultimate-guide-to-processing-simple-game) of Flappy Pong, expanding it to connect hardware components via the ESP32 and designing and laser cutting an enclosure for this “game controller.” My primary goal with this project was to create a game that could be fun and engaging, and while this continues to be an iterative process, I received positive feedback when I demonstrated it in a game expo with my classmates!

This gif shows the project hardware, enclosure, and software aspects all together, in action.. At the design documentation blog linked above, you can see a complete demo of the game.

This is the Fritzing diagram displaying the hardware connections to the ESP32:
